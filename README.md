Web Application (ECOMMERCE)
Hello, 
I have created this "Web Application" project using the knowledge that I've learned after completeion of course "Certificate in Digital Transformation Program- Java Enterprise in Devops.
In this project I've build an e-commerce application using Java.
Ecommerce Web Development is of two faces: one is the frontend and backend is the other.
Front-end scripting languages are the most essential subset of programming languages that perform specific functions within larger object-oriented back-end programming languages such as Java or C#.
